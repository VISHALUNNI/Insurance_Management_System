      <h1>Vehicle Insurance</h1>
      <p>
        Vehicle insurance, also known as auto insurance or car insurance,
        provides coverage for your vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, and
        other types of vehicles. It offers financial protection in the event of
        accidents, theft, or damage to your vehicle.

      <p>
        Vehicle insurance is a crucial component of responsible vehicle
        ownership. It not only protects you and your vehicle but also provides
        coverage for third-party liabilities.
